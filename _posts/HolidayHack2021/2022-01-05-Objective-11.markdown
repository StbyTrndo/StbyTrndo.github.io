## Objective
> A human has accessed the Jack Frost Tower network with a non-compliant host. [Which three trolls complained about the human](https://downloads.holidayhackchallenge.com/2021/jackfrosttower-network.zip)? Enter the troll names in alphabetical order separated by spaces.

## Analysis
That link is a link to a zip file with a packet capture (pcap) inside of it.

Let's analyze it using [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/)

A lot of the traffic here is just TCP Keep-Alive traffic or simple traffic establishing connections and whatnot. They all have length 66, so let's just filter those out. Right-click on a 66 and select "Apply as Filter" > "Not Selected" (or you could add `!(frame.len == 66)` as a filter).

This cuts things down to a much more reasonable amount of data. A quick skim through these shows a bunch of POST requests to `/feedback/guest_complaint.php`. This seems like what we want.

Clicking on one of these lines and opening the `HTML Form URL Encoded` section in the middle panel shows us the data posted in the form, including the person's name, guest info, and the complaint text.

Let's change our filter to show just these POST requests to this URL. If we expand the "Hypertext Transfer Protocol" section in the middle panel, we can right click on `POST /feedback/guest_comtplaint...` and select "Apply as Filter" > "Selected" to get just these requests.

Looking through these, they're all complaints *about* the guests, not *from* the guests... except for one from "Muffy VonDuchess Sebastian". The post says that their room number is 1024.

Looking at the other complaints, 3 of them are about the guest in room 1024 (a.k.a. Muffy). Here are the trolls who posted them:
- Yaqh
- Hagg
- Flud

**Answer:** Flud Hagg Yaqh
