## Overview
I am the manager of a Security Operations Center at a financial institution. In my role I work with teams across the globe to grow the firm's cyberseucrity capabilities, helping develop the team's strategy and drive its implementation.

I have developed skills in leadership, project management, cloud architecture development, security engineering, and programming; however, I consider my communication skills to be my greatest asset. I take pride in my ability to understand highly technical topics and translate them into concepts that can be easily understood by leadership and business partners.
